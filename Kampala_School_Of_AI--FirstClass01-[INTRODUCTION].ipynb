    "# What is Artificial Intelligence?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Artificial intelligence (AI)`, sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence includes other disciplines like:\n",
    "* `Machine Learning`:Deep learning is a type of machine learning that trains a computer to perform human-like tasks, such as recognizing speech, identifying images or making predictions. Instead of organizing data to run through predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns using many layers of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Deep Learning`: Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be summarized as below:\n",
